# Ground-based-Cloud-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

### About
---
Clouds are an indicator of climate and weather on earth. The ensemble of ra- diating effects can be affected by the presence of different cloud types. Therefore, identifying the type of cloud is important when characterising the climate of a re- gion. Furthermore, the classification of the different types or genres of clouds has the clear objective of predicting the weather of a region slightly in advance. So, what we want to solve on this occasion is a cloud classification problem. Traditional cloud classification or identification relies heavily on the experience of observers and is very time-consuming. We propose to develop a neural network for accurate cloud classification on the ground. To this end, we will explore convolutional neural net- work architectures, a vision transformer, as well as other models that have greater flexibility from little data.

### Implemented techniques for classification
---
* Convolutional Neural Network.
* Fine-tunning a classificator with MobileNetV2.
* Vision Transformer.
* Triplet-Loss function and siamese neural networks.

### Acknowledgments
---
In first place, I want to express my gratitude to all of my supervisors for their out- standing assistance, dedication, and expertise in assisting me with this project.
I would especially like to thank Jordi for patiently guiding me at all times and giving me the tools and the knowledge to overcome the obstacles that arose week after week. Also to Gerard for his support and for being the link of contact with Alfons Puertas – Oservatori Fabra, RACAB.
To Alfons Puertas for providing the magnificent photographs of the clouds, which although they have served to feed our models, have both a great scientific and artis- tic value.
I would want to express my gratitude to all of the professors who have con- tributed to the Fundamental Principles of Data Science Master’s Program at the University of Barcelona. I wouldn’t have developed the knowledge or inspiration for this project without this teaching.
