> In first place, I want to express my gratitude to all of my supervisors for their out- standing assistance, dedication, and expertise in assisting me with this project.
I would especially like to thank Jordi for patiently guiding me at all times and giving me the tools and the knowledge to overcome the obstacles that arose week after week. Also to Gerard for his support and for being the link of contact with Alfons Puertas – Oservatori Fabra, RACAB.
To Alfons Puertas for providing the magnificent photographs of the clouds, which although they have served to feed our models, have both a great scientific and artis- tic value.
I would want to express my gratitude to all of the professors who have con- tributed to the Fundamental Principles of Data Science Master’s Program at the University of Barcelona. I wouldn’t have developed the knowledge or inspiration for this project without this teaching.
